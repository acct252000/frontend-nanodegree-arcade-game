## Don’t Squash Me

Don’t Squash Me is a simple, endless internet browser game.  The goal is to gain points by collecting treasures and crossing the road to the river while avoiding collisions with giant bugs.

### Installation, or How To Run

1.  Download from the git repo [here](https://github.com/acct252000/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) by clicking on the green Clone or download button on the upper right side and selecting Download Zip.
2.  Unzip the files to your computer making sure to preserve the directory structure with the images, css and js folders as shown on GitHub.  
3.  Open index.html in web browser.  You can do this by putting the path to the file in the address bar of the web browser (i.e. file:///Users/username/Documents/index.html).  

### How to Play
The goal of the game is to cross the road into the river while collecting treasure.

The main character can be moved with the up, left, right, and down arrow keys.

Five treasures are randomly selected and placed at the beginning of each game.
Extra points are collected when the character moves to these treasures.  Point values are as follows:

- blue gem: 5
- green gem: 3
- orange gem: 1
- heart: 10
- key: 8

Crossing the road and reaching the river earns one point.

Watch out for bugs!  If a bug touches you the character will go back to the beginning and lose all points.

There is no set "winning", the game continues endlessly for as long as it is enjoyed.  To start a new game, simply refresh the browser.

### Known Issues

There are some extra images in the Github repository not used in the game saved for future development.
